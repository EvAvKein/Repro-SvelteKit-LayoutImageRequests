This is a repro repo <sub>(try saying that 10 times in a row)</sub> for a SvelteKit bug I encountered with my website

### Execution
1. Clone/copy the repo to your machine
2. Run ```npm install``` (assuming you have Node.js installed)
3. Run ```npm run dev```
4. Visit ```http://localhost:3000/``` and follow the instructions there
